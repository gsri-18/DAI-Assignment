## 🛠 Tasks & Methodologies
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning: Preprocessing for Reliable Analysis
 ✅ **Loading & Inspecting**: Checking data structure and attributes. <br>
 ✅ **Handling Missing Values**: Using imputation/removal techniques. <br>
 ✅ **Removing Duplicates**: Ensuring unique and accurate records. <br>
 ✅ **Outlier Detection & Treatment**: <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; *Mild Outliers* (age, height, games played): Median imputation. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; *Severe Outliers* (weight, points, assists, rebounds, etc.): Winsorization & log transformation. <br>
 ✅ **Standardizing Categorical Values**: Fixing typos and inconsistencies.<br>

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveiling Insights
#### 🔍 *Univariate Analysis (Single-Variable Exploration)*
 🔹 Summary Statistics: Mean, median, variance, skewness, etc.<br>
 🔹 Frequency Distributions for categorical attributes.<br>
 🔹 Visualizations: Histograms, box plots for distribution analysis.<br>

#### 🔍 *Bivariate Analysis (Two-Variable Relationships)*
 🔹 Correlation Matrix: Identifying relationships between numerical variables.<br>
 🔹 Scatter Plots: Exploring continuous variable dependencies.<br>
 🔹 Bar, Violin, and Box Plots: Comparing categorical & numerical attributes.<br>

#### 🔍 *Multivariate Analysis (Multi-Feature Relationships)*
 🔹 Pair Plots: Observing multiple variable interactions simultaneously.<br>
 🔹 Heatmaps: Visualizing correlations between different features.<br>
 🔹 Grouped Comparisons: Identifying combined effects of multiple factors.<br>

## 🔥 Key Techniques Implemented
🚀 **Handling Outliers Efficiently:**
- **Mild Outliers:** IQR method + Median imputation (age, height, games played).
- **Extreme Outliers:** Log transformation + Winsorization (weight, points, rebounds, assists, etc.).

📈 **Visualization-Driven Analysis:**
- **Boxplots:** Before/After outlier handling comparison.
- **Histograms:** Distribution analysis.
- **Heatmaps:** Exploring feature correlations.

 ✔ Well-cleaned dataset ready for analysis.<br>
 ✔ Statistical insights on player attributes.<br>
 ✔ Clear visual representations of trends and relationships.<br>
 ✔ Continuous comments on findings, aiding future predictive modeling.<br>
